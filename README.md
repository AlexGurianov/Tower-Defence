# Description
"New game" means a new game. So in order to start you should choose the appropriate option in the menu.

Different maps than occur. You can play whichever you want.

Than suddenly ghosts start to appear. Avoid their arriving at the right bottom corner.

There are several items in your arsenal. 

Appropriate pot is always preferable. Meaning that you must choose wisely. Otherwise you'll lose half of your money after demolishing failed attempts.

There are also dummy objects. Pay for them and they will help you to slow the pace of your enemies. But don't overuse them. It's not a secret that they are useless for killing ghosts.

After too much hearts disapeared you lose, and you shall always lose. "Game over" message appears. It's time to relax and see other options in the main menu. Don't hesitate press "Ok"

"Saved games" are stored. Create checkpoints when you are in a state of not wanting to continue at the moment.

You may consider yourself more creative than us. Show it with "New map" option. That's where the bounds diminish.

Play good, play fair... or just play alone. And you will find yourself in the "Hall of fame". The place of local(!) heroes.

Music is fabulous, fantastic and quite soothing. Turn it off immediatelly in "Settings". It's worth trying, telling ya'. 

Profiles are good. Satisfy your needs through deleting your wrong creations. Profiles are not ghosts. Killing them don't harm.

When bored try "Exit" option. Clicking on this option generates a whole new world of opportunities. Ghosts should stop hunting you at this moment.
