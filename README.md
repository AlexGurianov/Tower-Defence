# Description
"New game" means a new game. So in order to start you should choose the appropriate option in the menu.

Then different maps occur. You can play whichever you want.

Then suddenly the ghosts begin to appear. Avoid their arriving at the bottom right corner.

There are several items in your arsenal. 

Appropriate cauldron is always preferable. Meaning that you must choose wisely. Otherwise you'll lose half your money after demolishing failed attempts.

There are also dummy objects. Pay for them and they will help you to slow the pace of your enemies down. But don't overuse them. It's not a secret that they are useless for killing ghosts.

You lose after too many hearts have disappeared, and you shall always lose. "Game over" message appears. It's time to relax and see other options in the main menu. Don't hesitate to press "Ok"

"Saved games" are stored. Create checkpoints when you are in a mood of not wanting to continue at the moment.

You may consider yourself more creative than us. Show it with "New map" option. That's where the bounds diminish.

Play good, play fair... or just play alone. And you will find yourself in the "Hall of Fame". The place of local(!) heroes.

Music is fabulous, fantastic and quite soothing. Turn it off immediately in "Settings". It's worth trying, telling ya'. 

Profiles are good. Satisfy your needs through deleting your wrong creations. Profiles are not ghosts. Killing them don't harm.

When bored try "Exit" option. Clicking on this option generates a whole new world of opportunities. Ghosts should stop hunting you at this moment.
